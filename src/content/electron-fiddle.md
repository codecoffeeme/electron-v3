title: Electron Fiddle
---

[Electron Fiddle](https://www.electronjs.org/fiddle) is a tool for trying out ideas and sharing snippets of Electron functionality without having to go through all of the hassle of setting up a new Electron project each time. It's useful for submitting bug reports and showing off various ideas.

In this workshop, we're going to use it to set up various exercises and show off little pieces of functionality. We'll also build out full Electron applications on our devices.
