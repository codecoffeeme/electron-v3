title: Getting Set Up
---

You're going to need a few things in order to get rocking and rolling with this workshop.

- A relatively recent version of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org). We're using [18.17.0](https://github.com/nodejs/node/blob/main/doc/changelogs/CHANGELOG_V18.md#18.17.0), which is the current LTS release at the time of this workshop.
- [Electron Fiddle](https://www.electronjs.org/fiddle), which is a super cool tool for sharing and trying out different things with Electron. It's tagline is, "The _easiest_ way to get started with Electron." I think that's a fair synopsis. You can read more about [Electron Fiddle and how we're going to use it in this course here](./electron-fiddle).

## A Word on Electron Versioning

At the time of recording, the most recent, stable version of Electron is/was [v25.3.2](https://releases.electronjs.org/release/v25.3.2), which included [Chromium 114.0.5735.248](https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/refs/tags/114.0.5735.248:) and [Node 18.15.0](https://github.com/nodejs/node/releases/tag/v18.15.0).

Generally speaking, Electron's versions follow Chromium and Node versions. So, as long as the version numbers don't vary wildly, most of the examples in this workshop should work just fine with newer versions of Electron.
